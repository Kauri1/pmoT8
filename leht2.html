                Since its debut in 2009, League of Legends has evolved from a small population of desktop-computer warriors into a full-scale phenomenon. In the process, it has become an e-sport. Though e-sports were around for about a decade before Riot Games was born, no company has jumped in with the same intensity.

                Riot controls every aspect of the professional league, right down to the music composed for live events. It runs tournaments worldwide, 
                with its own slick broadcasting operation streaming to various Internet video sites, complete with color commentators and highlight reels â€” a kind of ESPN for gamers. 
                The company also keeps a few hundred professional players on salary, ensuring that they can spend up to 14 hours a day practicing, the time required to compete at the highest level.
